# Pizza Parlor

by Jeffrey Fisher.

A JavaScript interface for ordering pizza.

## Description

This is a small mockup of a pizza parlor website, created as part of my education at Fidgetech/Epicodus.

The interface on right-hand side has buttons for adding toppings to a pizza, and then another one to add to an order. The left interface is for ordering, and viewing what will be ordered.
